# Iris Flower Species Prediction

This is a mini Machine Learning project built using the Iris dataset from Kaggle. The model uses a Decision Tree Classifier
to predict the species of an Iris flower based on the four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal 
Width. You can input these values and the model will predict the corresponding species.

Information about the features:
1. SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal (in cm).
2. SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal (in cm).
3. PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal (in cm).
4. PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal (in cm).


The project has been deployed at: [Streamlit app](https://iris-classification-decision-tree.streamlit.app/)
